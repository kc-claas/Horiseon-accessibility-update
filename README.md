# <Horiseo accessibility update>

## Description

The goal was to update the Horiseo webpage for improved accessibility and SEO optimization. The HTML was updated to use semantic elements wherever possible and CSS modified to match. Additionally, code on both the HTML and CSS was cleaned up, removing unnecessary classes and ids and consolidating redundancies for better readability and easier modification moving forward.
